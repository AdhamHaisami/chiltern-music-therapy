## Part of the Catalyst and The National Lottery Community Fund COVID-19 Digital Response
The collaboration was made possible by CAST and the National Lottery Community Fund. This fund is aimed at organisations whose work has been affected by COVID-19 and who need emergency funding to continue to deliver essential services. It will support them to develop the digital, data and design capabilities that allow them to address urgent issues and serve the most vulnerable.

## Project outputs overview
- Validated user journeys 
- Mobile prototypes
- Questions set to help someone understand their digital skill level
- Prioritised backlog
- ALPHA web app – ready to deploy 
- Live testing of the ALPHA product with real users
- Independent PEN security testing of the product


## User Needs Statements

- Music therapy beneficiaries in isolation
    - As a music therapy beneficiary unable to attend sessions in person I need user-friendly, digital access to online therapy services and personalised therapeutic content so that I can continue my therapy plan, in a way that is consistent, flexible and accessible by beneficiary and therapist. 
- Music therapy beneficiaries gradually returning to in-person services 
    - As a music therapy beneficiary greatly affected by shortage of care services due to their slow return to normal availability, I need enhanced digital support in between in-person sessions to work towards therapeutic outcomes more effectively, according to my own timetable, using whatever web-enabled devices I have. 
- Music Therapists 
    - As a Music Therapist providing support services in-person and remotely/digitally, I need a secure, easy to use, cost-effective way to  upload clients’ personalised content and arrange their personalised therapeutic space and tasks according to their therapeutic plan and be confident of their attaining the full benefit of the therapy programme.
    - As a Music Therapist new to providing support services digitally, I might need some initial help to get confident and comfortable with this new way of working, so that I can reach optimal confidence, efficiency and effectiveness quickly.
- Wider Music Practitioners and Therapists
    - As a practitioner I need to understand and learn about risks associated with online digital therapy delivery, and how I can protect vulnerable people I work with, using well-researched and robustly secure platforms, storage and data-sharing.
